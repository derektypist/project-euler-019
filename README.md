# Project Euler 019 - Counting Sundays

You are given the following information, but you may prefer to do some research for yourself.

- 1 Jan 1900 was a Monday
- Thirty Days has September,
  April, June and November.
  All the rest have thirty-one,
  Saving February alone,
  Which has twenty-eight, rain or shine.
  And on leap years, twenty-nine.

A leap year occurs on any year divisible by 4, but not on a century, unless it is divisible by 400.

The aim is to find the number of Sundays that fall on the first of each month.  For example, during the 20th century (1 January 1901 to 31 December 2000).
